## Introduction
Data scientists are working with data all the time. The most often the data are provided by task owner/project manager. Those data 
are crucial. However, sometimes the data doesn't exist (are not generated), or would be great to enrich the existing data with some additional features
-- e.g. weather, social network comments, forums etc. Internet is one of the best/biggest data sources for many areas - social media research, various
online marketing campaigns or climate data.

In this notebook we will show how to get/scrape data from the Internet. We will demonstrate that it is relatively easy to get data also from complex
web-pages with JavaScript, sessions and other modern web-programming elements.

## Web scraping
The process of getting data from a web is called [Web scraping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_scraping). Scraping a web page, involves fetching 
it and extracting data from it. There are many ways and tools how to do it. In this notebook we will work with R since R is routinely used by many 
data scientist. 

We will show how to scrape data technically, however we need to be aware of [law aspect]((https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_scraping#Legal_issues)) 
as well. Some companies do not want to process their pages by robots. The law is not complete and it varies country by country and it is still 
evolving.

### Simple approach -- mainly static context
Let's do the web scraping with [rvest](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rvest) package. First, we need to find/localize what 
data we are interested in. We need to know [*XPath*](https://www.w3schools.com/xml/xpath_intro.asp) 
or some other form of the location within the web page. 
For this, we can use [Firebug](http://getfirebug.com/) plugin (there are many similar tools).

Let's say we want to get information about a score in film from [IMDB](http://www.imdb.com). We pick one particular movie, e.g. 
[The Lego Movie](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1490017/),
open it in Firefox and activate the Firebug plugin.

![](firebug.jpg)

Click on the element inspector (number 1 in the picture above), find the element with the score and click on it (number 2), Firebug will emphasize 
the element in the page source code (number 3). We can get/copy the exact XPath/CSS/html by clicking the right button on the element. In our case it is:

* XPath: `/html/body/div[1]/div/div[4]/div[5]/div[1]/div/div/div[2]/div[2]/div/div[1]/div[1]/div[1]/strong/span`
* HTML: `<span itemprop="ratingValue">7.8</span>`

In general, it is better not to work with the exact path from the root `/html`, since even a slight change in the code would
break our scraping (path will become invalid). Therefore we will work with a simpler path.
From the source code, we can see that one element above our `<span>` is `stronger`.  Let's stick with `<stronger><span>` for now. 

Open R Studio and start the scraping! Load libraries

```{r results='hide'}
library(tidyverse)
library(rvest)
```

Try to get the score
```{r}
lego_url <- "http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1490017/"

rating <- read_html(lego_url) %>% 
  #search for elements <strong> <span>
  html_nodes("strong span") %>%
  #take a text string from span element
  html_text() %>%
  #convert to number
  as.numeric()

rating
```

With some 5 lines of R code we got the score for *The Lego Movie*. Now it should be easy to run this code against any set of movies on [IMDB](http://www.imdb.com)

This is a good approach for getting mainly static data (e.g. Wikipedia pages), however it is not
possible to use for getting dynamic context (like social media that use logins and complex JavaScript). 

### Scraping complex dynamic pages

A simple use case for the start -- _let's find a mean price for properties in Bronx on
[zillow.com]("https://www.zillow.com/homes/for_sale/Castle-Hill-Bronx-New-York-NY/pmf,pf_pt/270812_rid/globalrelevanceex_sort/40.828359,-73.826516,40.809652,-73.87265_rect/14_zm/)_.
First, we need to found out a number of properties, in the upper right corner
![](nproperties.jpg)

With Firebug, we find out - we need XPath: `//div/h2` (why this string, or what other strings might lead to the same result - is a homework for you :))

```{r}
properties <- read_html("https://www.zillow.com/homes/for_sale/Castle-Hill-Bronx-New-York-NY/pmf,pf_pt/270812_rid/globalrelevanceex_sort/40.828359,-73.826516,40.809652,-73.87265_rect/14_zm/") %>% 
  html_nodes(xpath = '//div/h2')
```
That should be it, however if we take a look on results - it is empty
```{r}
length(properties)
```

In our web-browser there is 86 results instead ...

The answer is simple but definitely not obvious. `rvest` uses `curl` for browsing/downloading web pages. `curl` is a great command line 
tool but definitely not good fit for JavaScript. If we check what exactly _curl_ got:
```{bash}
curl "https://www.zillow.com/homes/for_sale/Castle-Hill-Bronx-New-York-NY/pmf,pf_pt/270812_rid/globalrelevanceex_sort/40.828359,-73.826516,40.809652,-73.87265_rect/14_zm/" > zillow_curl.html
```

Open `zillow_curl.html` in a browser -- it is slightly different!

![](nproperties2.jpg)


Therefore we need something that emulates a proper browser... There are great tools: [PhantomJs](http://phantomjs.org/) -- PhantomJS is a 
headless WebKit scriptable with a JavaScript API. [Selenium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selenium_(software)) -- enables web browser automation. 
It can work via IDE:
![Selenium IDE in Action](selenium-ide.png)

 or a driver.

These SW are great but we would need to speak 2 extra languages: Java and JavaScript. Fortunately, there is R wrapper 
[RSelenium](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RSelenium). A good introduction to the package can be found in the package [vignettes](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RSelenium/vignettes/), or 
[webinars](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RSelenium/vignettes/OCRUG-webinar.html)


Now, let's go back to our task

```{r results='hide'}
library(tidyverse)
library(RSelenium)
```

Initialize our session (browser).
```{r}
rD <- rsDriver(port=6539L, browser = "firefox")
remDr <- rD$client
```

and open the page

```{r}
remDr$navigate("https://www.zillow.com/homes/for_sale/Castle-Hill-Bronx-New-York-NY/pmf,pf_pt/270812_rid/globalrelevanceex_sort/40.828359,-73.826516,40.809652,-73.87265_rect/14_zm/")
```

we can play with it in many ways (get exact window/item position, screenshot, etc.)
For example, get a screenshot
```{r}
remDr$screenshot(display = TRUE)

```

![](screenshot.png)


We can see that the page is correct - it contains the info we need (number of properties).
Let's find the number via FireBug. Once we have the path, we can validate it via _RSelenium_ (show the element with yellow background for 
5 seconds)
```{r}
found <- remDr$findElement(using = "xpath",value='//div/h2')
found$highlightElement(wait = 5)
```

![Notice the yellow background](item_emphasized.jpg)

Great! It is working. Now get the number
```{r}
library(stringr)

elem <- remDr$findElement(using="xpath",value='//div/h2')$getElementText()
results <- as.integer(str_match(elem[[1]],"(\\d+) homes")[[2]])
```

Similarly, check the number of pages. Please notice, we are using _findElement**s**_ instead if _findElement_!
```{r}
elem <- remDr$findElements(using="xpath",value='//div/ol/li')
pages <- length(elem) - 1

```

Now, try to scrape the ads from the page. 


One URL link per ad
```{r}
elem_link <- remDr$findElements(using ="xpath", value = "//article/div/a")
links <- sapply(elem_link,function(x){x$getElementAttribute(attrName = "href")})
links <- unlist(links)
head(links)
```

Price per ad
```{r}
elem_price <- remDr$findElements(using ="css", value = 'span[class=zsg-photo-card-price]')
prices <- sapply(elem_price,function(x){x$getElementText()[[1]]})
head(prices)
```

Type of property, number of rooms and square feet
```{r}
elem_info <- remDr$findElements(using ="css", value = 'span[class="zsg-photo-card-info"')
info <- sapply(elem_info,function(x){tmp<-x$getElementText()[[1]];str_split(tmp,"·")})
types <- sapply(info,function(x){x[1]})
rooms <- sapply(info,function(x){x[2]})
sqfts <- sapply(info,function(x){str_trim(x[3])})

head(sqfts)
  
```

We have all the information about property type, number of rooms, price, link, and area for each ad on the page. Let's put it into 
newly created tibble
```{r}
properties <- tibble(url=character(),price=character(),type=character(), room=character(), sqft=character())
properties <-properties %>%  add_row(url = links, price=prices, type=types, room=rooms, sqft=sqfts)
head(properties)

```

This step sometimes fails with the error: `Error: Column `price` must be length 1 or 25, not 24`. Check the page and think about the price - why
there are fewer price tags than ads?

As a final step we need to make a loop for processing each page. Here you can see we solved the issue with price - think about the difference in 
code.


```{r}
properties <- tibble(url=character(),price=character(),type=character(), room=character(), sqft=character())

for(page in 1:pages){
  print(paste("page:",page))
  
  #load page (1st page is already loaded - skip it)
  if(page!=1){
    url_page=paste0("https://www.zillow.com/homes/for_sale/Castle-Hill-Bronx-New-York-NY/pmf,pf_pt/270812_rid/globalrelevanceex_sort/40.828359,-73.826516,40.809652,-73.87265_rect/14_zm/",page,"_p")
    remDr$navigate(url_page)
  }
  print("Loaded")

  #links
  elem_link <- remDr$findElements(using ="xpath", value = "//article/div/a")
  links <- sapply(elem_link,function(x){x$getElementAttribute(attrName = "href")})
  links <- unlist(links)
  
  #prices
  elem_price <- remDr$findElements(using ="css", value = 'div[class=zsg-photo-card-caption]')
  prices <- sapply(elem_price,function(x){str_match(x$getElementText()[[1]],"\\$([\\d+,K]+)")[[2]]})

  #
  elem_info <- remDr$findElements(using ="css", value = 'span[class="zsg-photo-card-info"')
  info <- sapply(elem_info,function(x){tmp<-x$getElementText()[[1]];str_split(tmp,"·")})
  types <- sapply(info,function(x){x[1]})
  rooms <- sapply(info,function(x){x[2]})
  sqfts <- sapply(info,function(x){str_trim(x[3])})

  #add results to flats
  properties <-properties %>%  add_row(url = links, price=prices, type=types, room=rooms, sqft=sqfts)
  print(" .... OK")
}
```

Double check the results
```{r}
dim(properties)
```

And check the first few lines
```{r}
head(properties)
```

### What next?
Standard feature engineering:
- make _price_ column consistent
- Are _room_ and _sqft_ columns OK?
- what other data/information we might need for our analysis

By solving these questions, we create a valid data source for our data science work.
For example, lets count how much space is for sell (how many sqft):
```{r}
properties$sqft2 <- str_replace(properties$sqft, "\\s*sqft\\s*","") %>% str_replace(",","") %>% as.numeric()
sum(properties$sqft2, na.rm = TRUE)
```
